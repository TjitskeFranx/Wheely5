Week 1 [16-20 Sep]
Activities:
-Setting up. Trying to set the RP and connect it. Only partially successful.
-Ideating on a concept for a connected wheelchair

Main Problems:
-couldn't successfully install Python on 1 PC
-couldn't successfully setup RP or link to DCD (as DCD was out of service)

Progress:
build the foundation for the project's concept

___________________________________________________
Week 2 [23-27 Sep]
Activities:
-Working on Arduino to turn a Tile [button] for one team [red led] or another team [blue led]
-Continuing to setup Raspberry Pi [RP] with help of tech support
-developing project concept further and thinking of its architecture and sensors

Progress:
-setting up foundation of hardware I/O of the project
-Successfully setting up RP in the project
-Making concept Vision [vision.jpg], first iteration of project io architecture and list of sensors actuators

___________________________________________________
Week 3 [30-4 Sep/Oct]
Activities:
-Following tutorials of html/css/java/python. Being able to link it all in a basic way
-Write a 'simulation code' that simulates a 'score' in the game (random division between Red, Blue, and Neutral Tiles)
-Connect a Smartphone to the bluetooth module to activate a light
-

Progress:
-Setting up the beginning of the web-application
- After two days of work, we manage to connect the smartphone to the bluetooth module. The Smartphone uses an application 'Bluecontrol'.
With this app we were able to turn on and of a led light via a bluetooth connection.

Week 4 [7-11 Oct]
Activities:
-Plan and discuss course next weeks
-figure out how to auto-update web application and create a time-element in js to make simulation code dynamic
-make js simulation ''algorithm'' dependent on dynamic score (if Red has many Tiles, it will be harder to get more of them)
-link this js to html and create a visual 'design' of the web application to show scores between 2 teams over time
-Setup a bluetooth hardware with connection to the Arduino
-Make this bluetooth module a device which scans for other devices and detects the RSSI

Main problems:

Progress:
-Create OK-looking web-application display of the game with Js Html and Css (only linked to simulation code)
-Decide on a 'ideal yet feasible' IoT architecture for the project [architecture.jpg]
-Decide on a planning for the project [planning.txt].
-The bluetooth module is connected to the arduino and can search for other devices via AT commends. Unfortunately, we could not program
the AT commends in the void loop setting.
-The serial monitor showed the devices found by the bluetooth module. The next step was to integrate a treshold which determines the
distance between the bluetooth device (transmitter) and the receiver. This was not successful since the AT+INQ: <Param1>,<Param2>,<Param3>,
Param1: Bluetooth address, Param2: device type, Param3: RSSI signal
Param3: was not showed in the serial monitor and we do not know why.

Week 5 [14 & 18 Oct]
Activities:
-Trying to work out the LoRaWAN connection
-Connecting the Bluetooth module with the arduino code
-Meeting with Jacky

Main problems:


Progress:
-Managed to give AT commends to the Bluetooth module automatic presented in the serial monitor
-Explore the  possibilities with the LoRa module. Not much progress meet next week with Martin Havenak
-Module can't be found by the things Network
